# Notes:  
- The OCCI library files are `64-bit based`. The system should be 64-bit.
- All configurations needed for integrating the OCCI library are done. Just clone the repo and test.
- Oracle Database on the system itself might be needed (not sure). Run the code and hopefully it works without asking for it (it shouldn't because we are using OCCI, a portable library).
- `Database`, a basic class for connecting to the database and running commands is implemented.
